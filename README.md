Implementation of Longest Common Subsequence (LCS).
Implemented the LCS algorithm using dynamic programming to find the longest subsequence common to two sequences.
Constructed a cost matrix to efficiently compute subsequence lengths and directions for reconstruction.
Demonstrated how dynamic programming reduces redundant calculations and improves efficiency.
LCS has applications in DNA sequence analysis, file comparison, and text processing.
